## Software and Packages 

The below list is software packages and pipelines that I developed for previous projects.
   * **NSP**: Next generation sequencing analysis pipeline. This pipeline is for next generation sequencing analysis (alignment by bwa and call the genotype by samtools, GATK and Platypus).
   * **NSA**: Next generation sequencing annotation analysis pipeline. This pipeline is for routine annotation analysis for sequencing data using VEP in ensembl.
   * **EDS**: EBV diagnostic system. This system is for routine breeding value diagnostic (pipeline report and diagnostic plot).
   * **GPS**: Genomic Prediction System. This software system is for routine genomic evaluation.
   * **GPT**: Genomic Parentage Test. This package is for routine parentage test.
   * **GIS**: Genomic Imputation System. This package is for routine genomic imputation analysis.
   * **GCP**: Genomic Data Clean pipeline. This pipeline is for routine genomic data preprocessing, cleaning.
   * **paraPT**: This program is for parentage test using parallel programing.
   * **gpuPCA**: This program is for running PCA analysis using genomic data by GPU.
   * **emGWAS**: This package is for GWAS data preparation and analysis using GCTA and PLINK2.
   * **mapConvertor**: This program is for converting the different map coordinator.
   * **emINB**: This program is for inbreeding coefficient calculated using pedigree and genomic data.
   * Some Shinny apps.
